# Flutter Firebase Cloud Messaging Receiver

A Flutter app to receive Firebase Cloud Messaging notifications. It was built to be used with [Firebase Cloud Messaging Notifier](https://github.com/bryanlincoln/fcm-notifier), a package I made to notify about Machine Learning models training status.

## Usage

-   Download the latest apk release [here](https://github.com/bryanlincoln/flutter-fcm-receiver/releases)
-   Install it on your Android Phone
-   Open it and click the floating button to copy your device's token
-   Use the token to send notifications to your phone

## Credits

-   [Flutter FCM](https://github.com/Kashifalaliwala/Flutter-FCM) was used as a starting point to notification handling.
